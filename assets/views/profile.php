            <p>Off shoring is about increasing business efficiency to grow faster. Save 50% on costs, or hire twice as many employees offshore. We provide you an affordable source of experienced programmers and allow you the flexibility of filling vacancies of your staff at your convenience and as per your requirements.

Though your hired staff would be working in our office, they would work for you in tune with your work environment and works only and directly for you. In other words such hired staff would follow your company's procedures, project plans and deadlines. And you can change your Developer, stop or change your work schedule at any point of time with or without attributing any reason.</p>
